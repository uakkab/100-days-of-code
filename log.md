**Today's Progress**: I have reviewed the Three Tier Archiecture used to built Apps, which is Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer and Data Access Layer, Few others things were the difference between framework and library, along with the difference between imperative and declartive. I am focusing on learning ReactJS along with Ruby on Rails.

**Thoughts:** The idea is to built the front end in the ReactJS and backend in Ruby on Rails.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
